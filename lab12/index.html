                <p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I was able to explore a little more with this lab than others and it took trial and error to get the results I wanted. One thing I was confused about however, was the code for how the output text was displayed. I just don't quite understand how the expressions are used to display the output, and how they connect to the input.</p>
