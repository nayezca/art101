			<h1>＊˚*•̩̩͙✩•̩̩͙*˚ Hello World! ˚*•̩̩͙✩•̩̩͙*˚＊</h1>
			<p>My name is Nayezca and I am a third year art major. I love to experiment in various types of art mediums, with my favorites being digital/video art, drawing and painting, crafting and jewelry making, and sculpture. I also love to dance! I am part of two amazing dance teams at UCSC; a Hip-Hop competition team and a kpop cover team. My partner is Geraldine, who is a third year psychology and legal studies major. We both have little to no experience with coding but are excited to learn together!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>✩ Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems that arose included getting lost in the coding and instructions, and having to keep reviewing the assignment instructions. I had started this assignment before Tuesday's lecture so many of the issues I initially ran into were then explained in class. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>✩ Reflection</h2>
					<p>With this assignment, I did a lot of experimenting and playing around with different things at first. I have very little experience with coding and am still learning all the terms and meanings of specific code, but did have a lot of fun seeing what could be done just by changing or adding code.</p>
