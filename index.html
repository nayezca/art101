					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi! My name is Nayezca and I am a 3rd year art major at UCSC. I love to experiment with many different types of art (I love jewelry making, painting, collaging, and digital art/video editing the most!). I am also a dancer! I dance with two teams at UCSC; The first is Crz Ctrl which is a competitive hip-hop/open-style dance team, and the second is Starchrome which is an audition based kpop cover team! A few more things about me: I am from the bay area, I LOVE dogs, and one of my favorite things in life is getting to be an older sister to my two younger sisters. ♡ </p>
